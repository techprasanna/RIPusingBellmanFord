# RIPusingBellmanFord
This is a Java application where every node uses Routing Information Protocol (RIP v2) to discover other nodes in the network and calculates the shortest path to every node using Distance Vector algorithm.

1) To run the program, execute the java program as a normal java program and give the node number as argument 0
2) The program covers the following:
	1) Generating router table with all the neighbours using RIPv2 protocol
	2) Assigning them the cost of 1
	3) Assigning the cost of 0 to self node.
	4) Implementing the Distance Vector Protocol using RIP v2
